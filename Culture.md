# What is culture?

\#What is culture?

Culture is often defined in many ways, but one perspective that resonates deeply with GovEx is this:\
**Culture is the difference between what you tolerate and what you don’t.**

At first glance, that may seem straightforward. But culture becomes far more complex once you begin to unpack it.

Culture is not a single thing—it is the _unconscious interaction_ of many elements: people, values, assumptions, processes, shared norms, goals, traditions, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and everyday practices. When people talk about “culture,” they’re usually referencing just one or a few of these components. In reality, culture is an interconnected system—so understanding it means thinking systemically, not simplistically.

#### Culture Is Both Causal and Dependent

Culture shapes outcomes. It influences how decisions are made, how people behave, how residents are served, and how trust is built. But it also _responds to_ organizational inputs—such as talent, leadership, technology, structures, and strategic priorities. In this way, culture both drives and is driven by performance, relationships, and institutional capacity.

#### Culture Is Plural, Not Singular

There is no single culture in any complex organization. Governments especially are home to many **subcultures and microcultures** across departments, teams, and leadership levels. So when people ask, “How do we change the culture?” the first question should be, “Which one?”\
Without clarity and coordination, multiple cultures can create friction, inequity, and confusion—especially for residents interacting with public services.

#### Culture Is a Malleable Legacy

Culture is neither fixed nor instantly changeable. It is the product of what people _repeatedly do_—and what leaders consistently reinforce or ignore. Some believe culture can’t change; others believe a new leader can transform it overnight. Both views are mistaken.

**Sustainable culture change requires intentionality, time, and reinforcement.** While leadership plays a critical role in signaling priorities and modeling expectations, true change takes root through aligned structures, practices, metrics, and sustained behavior over time.

#### Best Practices and Recent Learnings

1. **Define and operationalize values**\
   Values only matter when translated into specific behaviors and decisions. Clarify what the organization _expects_, _accepts_, and _rewards_.
2. **Align systems and incentives**\
   Culture change is fragile if systems—like hiring, onboarding, evaluation, or budgeting—work at cross-purposes with the desired culture.
3. **Measure culture consistently**\
   Use tools such as engagement surveys, behavioral audits, and focus groups to track progress and surface misalignments.
4. **Cultivate psychological safety**\
   A learning culture thrives when people feel safe to speak up, take risks, and learn from failure—without fear of retribution.
5. **Model the change at every level**\
   Culture does not shift from the top alone. Peer influence, mid-level management, and front-line norms all matter deeply.
6. **Recognize and address power dynamics**\
   Who sets the norms? Who is heard? Equitable culture change requires attending to how identity, privilege, and exclusion show up in daily work.
7. **Use stories and symbols strategically**\
   Narratives, rituals, and symbols are powerful tools for reinforcing what matters. Make the invisible visible.
