# View Culture as an Advantage

\#View Culture as an Advantage

Rather than seeing culture as an obstacle, organizations should recognize and harness its strengths. Every culture has unique assets that can be leveraged for positive change. For instance, if employees are hesitant to alter inefficient processes due to concerns about fraud, waste, or abuse, that hesitation reflects a deep commitment to fiscal responsibility. **Celebrate that commitment**—and use it as a foundation for building trust in reform.

Leaders should actively communicate these cultural strengths to key stakeholders, including the legislative branch, to build understanding and alignment. Explaining _why_ culture change is happening—and how it honors core values—helps reduce resistance and foster support.

**Transparency is critical.**\
There should be no surprises on the path to culture transformation. Everyone involved—from employees to external partners—should clearly understand the tangible changes to expect in programs, services, and day-to-day work. This clarity boosts confidence in the organization and empowers stakeholders to advocate for and explain the change to residents.
