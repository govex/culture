# Measure Progress: Track What Matters and Listen to Who Matters



Sustainable culture change requires more than good intentions—it requires consistent measurement and honest feedback.

Start by identifying a **core group of trusted influencers** across the organization. These individuals may not always hold formal titles, but they are well-respected, widely connected, and attuned to the organization’s informal dynamics. Engage them regularly as sounding boards. Their candid, grounded insights can help leadership understand whether culture change efforts are gaining traction—or facing headwinds.

In addition to qualitative feedback, establish **clear, multi-dimensional metrics** to track progress. Ask:

* **Are we improving in our core operations?**\
  Culture should enhance—not distract from—mission delivery. Look for measurable improvements in service quality, efficiency, and outcomes.
* **Are the right behaviors becoming more visible and consistent?**\
  Identify the few _critical behaviors_ that signal the culture you want and monitor whether they’re showing up more often across teams and functions.
* **Are we following through on agreed-upon changes?**\
  Use implementation checklists or project milestones to ensure that formal commitments—such as new policies, processes, or training—are actually being executed.
* **Are employee attitudes shifting in the desired direction?**\
  Use pulse surveys, interviews, and focus groups to gauge shifts in trust, engagement, accountability, and alignment with cultural values.

Above all, **ensure your metrics are tied to behaviors, not just beliefs**. Culture changes when people act differently over time—and when the system rewards those actions. By measuring what matters and learning from those who live the culture every day, you build a continuous feedback loop that turns culture from an abstract idea into a real driver of performance and purpose.
