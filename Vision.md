# Create a Compelling Vision

\#Create a Compelling Vision of the Culture You Want (But Account for the Culture You Have).

If the leadership team has not already committed to managing with data, then begin with a leadership vision of the future. Some describe this as a leadership postcard: a simple compelling story of where you want the organization to go. For example, a mayor may routinely describe her vision to her leadership team:

> In the City of Springfield, good is never good enough. We deliver the best services to residents because we constantly collaborate and use data to figure out how to outperform ourselves.

**Avoid vague descriptions of your desired culture.**\
Terms like _innovative_, _collaborative_, or _customer-centric_ are too abstract to guide real change. Instead, define culture in clear, tangible terms that describe what it should **feel like from within** the organization. For example:\
&#xNAN;_“We promote innovation by empowering diverse teams to collaborate on city-wide initiatives that improve resident outcomes.”_

A strong cultural vision like this should align with and build on existing strengths. If employees take pride in serving residents, for instance, the vision should reflect that priority to foster connection and buy-in.

To develop a cultural vision that is both **aspirational and authentic**, engage employees across the organization—especially those who are well-respected and deeply familiar with how things work today. Involve them not just in shaping the vision but also in identifying practical ways to bring it to life.

Ultimately, **coherence among culture, strategy, and performance priorities** is essential. When your vision is grounded in reality, aligned with values, and clearly connected to day-to-day work, culture becomes a catalyst—not a barrier—for progress.
