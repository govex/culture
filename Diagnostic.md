# Diagnosing Culture

\#Diagnosing Culture

There is [a culture diagnostic tool](http://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=559077c25e9d9768f68b4570\&assetKey=AS%3A271750183489537%401441801700739) developed by Kim Cameron and Robert Quinn in 2006. It essentially states there are four types of organizational cultures, which exist along a _competing values framework_. The competing values are:

* Flexibility & Discretion vs. Stability & Control
* Internal Focus & Integration vs. External Focus & Differentiation

Using these values, Cameron and Quinn group organizations into four cultural categories depending on their results:

* **Clan Culture:** This culture is **collaborative and people-centered**, often described as a family-like environment. Teamwork, loyalty, and mutual support are emphasized. Leaders act as mentors or coaches, and the organization prioritizes **cohesion, tradition, and employee well-being**. Success is defined by internal climate and long-term development.
* **Adhocracy Culture:** Defined by **innovation, agility, and entrepreneurship**, this culture thrives in dynamic, fast-paced environments. Organizations encourage risk-taking, individual initiative, and creativity. Leaders are visionary and willing to push boundaries. The focus is on being **cutting-edge and leading the industry** through bold ideas and experimentation.
* **Market Culture:** This type is **competitive, results-driven, and externally focused**. Performance, productivity, and achieving measurable goals are top priorities. Leaders are hard-driving and demanding, and success is defined by market share, profitability, and reputation. Winning matters, and accountability is paramount.
* **Hierarchy Culture:** controlled, structured, formal, rules and procedures emphasized, dependability, stability, performance, and efficient operations are prioritized

\###First, identify the culture you want. Many governments identify as a Hierarchy Culture and aspire to be different. But it is important to be specific and articulate what kind of culture you want, so the differences become clear. As you complete a diagnostic process, make note of the differences between the culture you have and the one you want.

\###Second, interview and observe.

* Observe the common behaviors in your organization and ask others to observe them as well.
  * Which behaviors contribute to your goals?
  * Which behaviors detract from your goals?
* If you were performing at your best, which behaviors would be common? Which would be gone?
  * How would we treat residents differently?
  * How would employees exchange ideas with one another?
  * How would challenging issues get raised and resolved within the organization?
* Notice what words people use when they describe the challenges and opportunities in their organization
  * Do they say “us” and “we” or do they say “they” or “them.” The latter may indicate a lack of ownership in both the problem and the solution.
  * For example, do people talk as if “data” is someone else’s domain, like the IT department?
  * Do they say “can’t” or “won’t” or “shouldn’t” more than they say “can” or “could” or “should?” These words choices indicate the level of risk aversion and innovation among employees.
  * Do they more frequently talk about challenges than opportunities? Or is it the reverse?
  * Do they contribute to each other’s ideas or tear them down?
  * Do they talk about they way things used to be with nostalgia? Or do they talk about the way things could be with optimism?
  * Can they explain why they do certain activities or why your programs operate the way they do? Or do they put those answers to a person higher in the organization?
* Conduct interviews with employees at all levels of the organization. Focus on those who are well respected, informally influential, and attuned to the organization's culture.
* Ask everyone who they consider the ultimate stakeholder. The differences in perspectives will reveal cultural disconnects and opportunities for alignment around a common mission and vision.
* Interview stakeholders about their perceptions of the organization? Ask them about their experiences as a “customer” and write down the common words they use to describe those experiences.
  * Treat perceptions of the organization as facts.
* Identify the sub-cultures and micro-cultures through interviews, and analyze social media feedback and differences between component perceptions.

\###Fourth, consider how the following factors are influencing your culture:

* Organizational Structure and Process
  * Centralization vs. decentralization
  * Autonomy vs. micro-management
  * Reporting structures and spans of control
  * Decision making processes
  * Information flows
* People
  * Leaders
  * Managers
  * Front Lines
  * Customers
  * Stakeholders
* Incentives
  * Compensation
  * Seniority
  * Recognition
  * Access
* Performance Management
  * Results/Evaluations
  * Feedback
  * Frequency
  * Remediation/Accountability
